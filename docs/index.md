## Documentation Notation

- Any argument that is wrapped with a `[]` is **optional**.
- Any argument that is wrapped with a `<>` is **required**.
- A `|` after the argument means that you can use either of the arguments.
- A `{}` after the argument means you can use those variables in it to create dynamic stuff.

!!! tip "Regular Tip"
    Arguments that have a `?` after them have to be followed by a rule.

    **For example:** If you have a argument - `<time?number>`, it states that time has to be a number and nothing else. 

    You can even see an another type - `<time?(number|literal)>`, it states that time can either be a number or a literal.
